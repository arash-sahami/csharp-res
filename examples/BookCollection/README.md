# Book Collection Example

This is an example RES service that shows a lists of books, where book titles can be added,
edited and deleted by multiple users simultaneously.
* It exposes a collection, `library.books`, containing book model references.
* It exposes book models, `library.book.<BOOK_ID>`, of each book.
* It allows setting the books' *title* and *author* property through the `set` method.
* It allows creating new books that are added to the collection with the `new` method.
* It allows deleting existing books from the collection with the `delete` method.
* It verifies that a *title* and *author* is always set.
* It resets the collection and models on server restart.

## Prerequisite

* Have [NATS Server](https://nats.io/download/nats-io/gnatsd/) and [Resgate](https://github.com/jirenius/resgate) running

## Install and run

Clone csharp-res repository:

## Things to try out

**Realtime updates**  
Run the client in two separate tabs to observe realtime updates.

**System reset**  
Run the client and make some changes. Restart the node.js server to observe resetting of resources in clients.

**Resynchronization**  
Run the client on two separate devices. Disconnect one device, then make changes with the other. Reconnect the first device to observe resynchronization.
